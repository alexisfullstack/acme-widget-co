- Small, precise interfaces (`ProductCatalog`, `OfferStrategy`, `DeliveryPricingStrategy`)
- Dependency injection (catalog, delivery strategy, offers passed into `Basket`)
- Strategy pattern for delivery and offers
- Extensible design without rewriting existing code
- Unit tests (Vitest)
- Command-line demo, no UI or frameworks
